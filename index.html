           &nbsp; From classic fingers to chunky, original to peanut butter, there is a KitKat for everyone.

In Japan alone, flavors include wasabi and sake - while the gift of a KitKat is customary for students sitting their exams. The country's KitKat Chocolatory even lets you design your own dream KitKat.

KitKat is the first global chocolate brand to use 100% sustainably sourced cocoa through the Nestlé Cocoa Plan and Rainforest Alliance certified. Meaning there's no reason not to pause… and enjoy a break. </h4>
